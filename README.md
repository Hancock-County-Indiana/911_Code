# Code
Publicly available code
This is a repository for various python code that's used to automate geospatial processes that support 911.

The Fishbone code automates the process outlined in the Appendix D Word document which shows how to create a fishbone analaysis in ArcGIS without coding.  The final output (outFish shapefile) should provide the same results one would get if following the steps in Appendix D.  It will be necessary to create an address locator and modify the code so it points to local file paths (indicated with #CHANGE ME in the code).
