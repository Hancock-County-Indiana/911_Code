This is a repository for various python code that's used to automate geospatial processes that support 911.

The fishbone_v1.1.py code automates the process outlined in the Appendix D - Fishbone Analysis Word document which shows how to create a fishbone analaysis in ArcGIS.  The final output (outFish shapefile) should provide the same results one would get if following the steps in Appendix D.
